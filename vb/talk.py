"""voicebridge talk: hands-free voice link to your OPEN Claude session.

Channel-free (works on org accounts where Channels is disabled by policy).
You keep a normal interactive `claude` running in its own window; `vb talk`
runs beside it:

  mic -> local whisper -> typed into the focused Claude window (paste+Enter)
  session transcript -> new replies spoken aloud (Tara etc.)

Fire-and-forget by design: injection never waits on a reply, so 'stop'
always works. While waiting silently, a recording is cut short the moment a
reply lands, so answers are spoken promptly.

Requirements: keep the Claude window FOCUSED (the paste lands wherever your
cursor is), and start `vb talk` right after touching the session you want
voiced (it binds to the most recently active transcript, and re-binds after
your first spoken message).
